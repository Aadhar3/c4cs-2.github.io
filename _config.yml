  This 1-credit seminar is designed to teach the essentials of using a computer
  effectively for EECS students. While the target audience is CS/CE/DS
  students, any student wishing to learn how to use their computer much more
  effectively is encouraged to join. Topics covered include shells,
  environment, scripting, Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools, and version
  control. The last month of the course will be open to student input for
  remaining useful topics to cover.
