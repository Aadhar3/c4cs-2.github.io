	<p>This 1-credit seminar is designed to teach the essentials of using a
	computer effectively for EECS students. While the target audience is CS/CE/DS
	students, any student wishing to learn how to use their computer much more
	effectively is encouraged to join. Topics covered include shells, environment,
	scripting, Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools, and version control. The
	last month of the course will be open to student input for remaining useful
	topics to cover.</p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-advanced-duration"></a>2/4: Two Weeks for Advanced Homeworks</h4>
	<p>Advanced homeworks will now have a two week window for submission.
	This change first affects advanced homework 4, whose deadline is now
	extended until before lecture on the 12th. This means at any given
	time, two advanced homeworks will be &ldquo;in flight&rdquo;, one on
	its first week and one on its second week.  The pdf for advanced
	homework 4 has been updated to reflect this change.</p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-submit-special-topics"></a>1/30: Nominations for Special Topics Topics</h4>
	<p>The last four weeks of the semester are open to topics guided by
	course interest. We&rsquo;d like to start getting some suggestions from
	you all on what kind of things you would like to learn more about. If
	you have suggestions for things you think would be interesting,
	please submit them here:</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1bEdFiOZ1w_6aT1XgmvX2CLVPU1vlvbllrJVKq5Ago7g/viewform" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1bEdFiOZ1w_6aT1XgmvX2CLVPU1vlvbllrJVKq5Ago7g/viewform</a></p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-grade-ranges"></a>1/30: Fixing Ambiguous Grade Ranges</h4>
	<p>The grade ranges as originally published had ambiguous endpoints
	(e.g. 18-20&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A- and 20-24&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A, so what is a 20 worth?).
	I have fixed these such that all ambiguities favor the higher grade
	(e.g. 18-19&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A- and 20-24&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A), as was
	my original intent.</p>
	<p>Apologies for any confusion.</p>
	<!-- n.b. As a computer scientist, this was a particularly embarrassing mistake :/ -->

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-bonus1"></a>1/29: Bonus Advanced Homework</h4>
	<p>We have added a <a href="#bonus1">bonus advanced homework assignment</a>.
	In short, it awards you an advanced homework point if successfully submit a
	patch to an open source project. You may redeem this assignment any week and
	it may be in addition to that week's advanced homework. You must have
	public evidence of having started this assignment by March&nbsp;18th. For more
	details <a href="#bonus1">see the assignment</a>.

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-progress"></a>1/29: Viewing course grades / progress</h4>
	<p>A few people have asked for better feedback on grades and progress
	through the class. There is not a great way to do this on Gradescope,
	so I will be keeping cTools up to date with grades.</p>
	<p>The cTools grades for attendance and homework grades should be
	straightforward. For the advanced homework assignments, cTools doesn't
	have a great way of representing a &ldquo;choose 3 of 12&rdquo; system.
	I have added two categories, <em>Advanced Homework</em> and <em>Advanced
	Homework Raw</em>. Notice that the <em>raw</em> category has a 0% weight
	(it will not count in your final score). It is simply a placeholder for
	you to verify that your advanced homework has been counted. I will add
	final scores for advanced homeworks at the end of the semester.</p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-sections"></a>12/16: Two Additional Sections</h4>
	<p>We opened two additional sections today. Unfortunately, due the way
	that special topics classes are handled by the registration backend,
	there was no way to transfer the wait list to the new sections (this
	is a unique problem for special topics classes, and they aren't usually
	this popular...). To give the waitlisted students the best chance, we
	e-mailed only waitlisted students to alert them of the new sections and
	asked people to keep it quiet. It was the best we could do with an
	unfortunate situation.</p>
	<p>As of 8&nbsp;PM, both new sections are full. It looks like about 80%
	of the original waitlist was able to register. My sincerest apologies to
	those on the original waitlist who missed the window.
	At this point, we do not expect to open any more additional sections.</p>
	<p>Finally, I would like to extend an extra-special thank you to
	<a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/etc/fac/EECSfaculty.html?uniqname=mmdarden">Marcus Darden</a>,
	who agreed to teach an overload semester so we could add another
	section and allow more students to take the course.</p>
	<p>Looking forward to seeing you all next term. Best of luck on exams!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Pat</p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-full"></a>12/2: Wow! Registration is full!</h4>
	<h5>First, please add yourself to the waitlist if you are still interested in this class.</h5>
	<p>A large waitlist could help justify a larger classroom (if we can
	get one) or possibly additional sections (though I will say upfront
	this will take a little more doing and is less likely). With apologies
	to those who will not be able to enroll this term, as this is first
	time this course will be offered I&rsquo;m not sure I can handle
	something too enormous.</p>
	<p>While I appreciate the enthusiasm for this course,
	<strong>
		please don't e-mail me if you&rsquo;re on the waitlist to ask
		if you will be able to register</strong>.
	I will post any and all information about additional
	enrollment availability here as soon as I know.</p>
	<p>Thank you all for the support and enthusiasm.</p>

	<h4><a class="anchor update" name="update-credits"></a>11/20: This class will count as Flex Tech for CS, DS, and EE students and an EECS Elective for CE students <small>(note, extra EECS Elective credits can be used to fill Flex Tech credits for CE students)</small>.</h4>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="prereqs"></a>Course Pre-Requisites</h2>
The only enforced pre-requisite for this course is ENGN&nbsp;101/151 or
EECS&nbsp;182/183, however it is advised that students have either taken or are
concurrently enrolled in EECS&nbsp;280.  A basic understanding of programming
(if/else, for, while) and a passing familiarity with a compiler and command
prompt is the only expected background.

			Lecture opened with an example of an editor most people

			their behavior. Then we played with one of the first
			text editors, <tt>ed</tt>. The homework explores how
			some of <tt>ed</tt>'s interfaces live on today. From
			there we talked about the mental model of a software
			developer when editing software and how editors play
			into that. Finally, we closed lecture with a discussion
			on the distinction between text editors and source code
			editors, which of those are included in Integrated
			Development Environments (IDEs), and whether that is the
			right choice. The advanced homework explores how to
			bridge this gap in both directions, from source editor
			to IDE and from IDE with text editor to IDE with source
			editor.

<h2><a class="anchor" name="grading"></a>Attendance, Grading, and Homework</h2>
<p>
This course is graded on a straight scale, it will not be curved.
Each component is graded independently and then combined into a final grade.
As example, a student with 19 attendance points, 16 homework points, 3 advanced
exercise points, and a 95% on the final exam would receive a final grade of
(3.67+3.33+4.0+.95*4.0) / 4.0 = 3.7, 3.7&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3.67&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A.
</p>

<h3>Attendance (25%)</h3>

<p>Attendance is required for this course. Each lecture will begin with a
question from last week&rsquo;s material. A correct answer is worth 2&nbsp;points,
an incorrect answer is worth 1&nbsp;point, and no answer is worth 0&nbsp;points.
The week before spring break is optional with no attendance taken.
The maximum possible attendance score is thus 13&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;26.
</p>

<h3>Homeworks (25%)</h3>

<p>There are 12 homeworks in the course. Homework is due by the
<i>beginning</i> of the first lecture the week after it is assigned. Homeworks
will be graded on a {0,1,2} scale:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>0 points</dt><dd>No / very little effort</dd>
	<dt>1 point<dd>A solid effort, but not complete</dd>
	<dt>2 points<dd>Completed successfully</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a 1&nbsp;credit course and the homeworks are designed to be
commensurate with that. The goal of the homeworks is to reinforce concepts
introduced in lecture and to give hands-on experience working with tools.</p>
<p>An A&nbsp;student will have at least 18 total homework points (e.g. 6&nbsp;1's and 6&nbsp;2's).</p>

<h3>Advanced Exercises (25%)</h3>

<p>Each homework will have at least one advanced exercise option. The intention
is to give a guided exploration of topics that people find most interesting.
These advanced exercises will also be a little more time consuming, have a little
less guidance, and require you to research and discover a little on your own.
Over the course of the semester, you are expected to do at least three of the
advanced exercises.</p>
<p>The advanced exercises are graded on a simple 0 or 1 system, either you did
the whole thing or you did not. Some weeks may have multiple advanced exercise
options, however you may only earn 1 advanced exercise point per week (though
that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from doing more if you are interested!).</p>

<h3>Final Exam (25%)</h3>
<p><strong>Monday, April 4, 7:00-8:30</strong></p>
<p><i>Locations TBA</i></p>
<p>
The final exam will be cumulative over all of the whole term.
We have a 90-minute time slot for the exam.
This is a very broad course. The exam is not designed to be &ldquo;tricky&rdquo;
or test the esoteric corners of things presented in lecture. A student who
attended every lecture and completed all the homeworks will likely need minimal
studying for this exam.
</p>
<p>If you need any special accommodations, please let us know <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1Q6AtevV1kuffjf8HT3ZZhI9SGTqjYY_Cfh4GL6cPkZw/viewform" target="_blank">here</a> by March&nbsp;20th.</p>
